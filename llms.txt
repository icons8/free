# Free Format Specification

## Base Types

Free format is NULL-free, NaN-free and Infinity-free - if any of this values are in JSON - it's broken. 

* float - 32bit single-precision floating-point number
* int - 32bit signed integer
* byte - 8-bit unsigned integer
* bool - Boolean (true or false) value
* string - text as a sequence of UTF-8 code units
* GUID - globally unique identifier, with base64 encryption, length is always 22 chars. Examples: `R1o2w3_4D5i6n7g8_000AA`, `N1a2m3-4C5o6n7t8_910AA`, `reY4TrsLHUeFk-E0CtyS5A`

### Struct Matrix — A transformation matrix is standard way in computer graphics to represent translation and rotation. These are the top two rows of a 3x3 matrix. The bottom row of the matrix is assumed to be [0, 0, 1]. This is known as an affine transform and is enough to represent translation, rotation, and skew. The identity transform is [1, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0]. A translation matrix will typically look like: [1, 0, tx,  0, 1, ty] and a rotation matrix will typically look like: [cos(angle), -sin(angle), 0, sin(angle), cos(angle), 0] If a matrix contains only translation it will be printed like point [0,5]

And if mode and radius are zeros, it becomes ``[x, y]``
