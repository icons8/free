## Base Types

Free format is NULL-free, NaN-free and Infinity-free - if any of this values are in JSON - it's broken. 

* float - 32bit single-precision floating-point number
* int - 32bit signed integer
* byte - 8-bit unsigned integer

A translation matrix will typically look like: [1, 0, tx,   0, 1, ty]             and a rotation matrix will typically look like: [cos(angle), -sin(angle), 0, sin(angle), cos(angle), 0]             If a matrix contains only translation it will be printed like point [0,5]
