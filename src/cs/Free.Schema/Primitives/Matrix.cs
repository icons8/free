/// A transformation matrix is standard way in computer graphics to represent translation and rotation.
/// These are the top two rows of a 3x3 matrix. The bottom row of the matrix is assumed to be [0, 0, 1].
/// This is known as an affine transform and is enough to represent translation, rotation, and skew.
/// The identity transform is [1, 0, 0,   0, 1, 0].
/// A translation matrix will typically look like: [1, 0, tx,   0, 1, ty]
/// and a rotation matrix will typically look like: [cos(angle), -sin(angle), 0, sin(angle), cos(angle), 0]
/// If a matrix contains only translation it will be printed like point [0,5]
