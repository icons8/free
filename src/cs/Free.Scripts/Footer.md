## Changelog

### Version 3 - TBD

* `Link` property is replaced by `Flows` list of prototyping interactions.

### Version 2 - 11.08.2024

* `Shared.json` structure updated to be more efficient. Some sketch-related fields removed.
* Now `SharedStyle`s are not grouped by text/layer category. All in one container. To check if style is text style - check if it has text `TextStyle` property.
* `Export` optimized to be a simple list of `ExportOption`. Some sketch-related fields removed.
